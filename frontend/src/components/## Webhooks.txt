## Webhooks

>Webhooks receive information about a match as it is being setup.
> Each webhook will contain an "action" key in the payload.
> Currently supported actions are:
> - JOIN_QUEUE
> - LEAVE_QUEUE
> - MATCH_STARTED
> - TEAMS_CREATED
> - MATCH_COMPLETED
> - SUBSTITUTION
> 
> Additionally, if you have `/requireregister mode: Custom API`, you will receive a webhook with action
> - REGISTER_PLAYER
> 
> containing various information about the user, as well as the account they are attempting to register.
> You must either reply with a json object containing at least a "rating" key (ex: {"rating": 1000}), to specify the
> rating that the player should be registered with, or any non 200 status response to display to the user.
